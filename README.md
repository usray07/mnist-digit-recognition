# mnist-digit-recognition
In this project we aim to create a Hand –written Digit Recognition system with a Graphical User Interface which has a canvas on which user could draw a single digit and the python based  machine learning algorithm will detect which digit the user has drawn.

Handwritten Digit Recognition is a classification problem, where the model tries to classify the handwritten digit to any of the 10 numbers (Starting from 0 to 9). This is a supervised learning problem, and there is a widely popular dataset — MNIST Dataset, that comprises of 70,000 images of handwritten numbers and its labels. While most of the techniques are based on strong foundation, there are subtle or wide differences in their efficiencies. By efficiency, the accuracy, time required to get the result and other factor which can give one algorithm or techniques an edge over the rest. In this project, we aim to build a Machine Learning model with a GUI that lets the user hand-draw a number on the screen, and the model predicts the digit. The infamous Machine Learning algorithms K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine were used as classifiers. The GUI canvas for drawing the digits for training purposes is developed using Tkinter library of python. As the end result, we aim to deliver a working model for Handwritten Digit Classification problem with minimum error in accuracy.
